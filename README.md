# Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System

These are set of files for developing IoT based firmware for ESP32 using IDF (IoT Development Framework) provided by espressif. The files were rusty, definitely need to look :()<br />
Most of the files are self explanatory and feasibly understandable by mid level experienced embedded C programmer. Contents from basic GPIO testing to WIFI and Bluetooth Mesh were available. 
In brief, list of major concept's widely used in IoT communication and security with respect to files were:<br /><br />
- Advanced Encryption Standard  https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/AES.c<br /><br />
- Bluetooth Connection (Simple Serial Data Protocol Transfer) https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/BT_Test.c<br /><br />
- MESH Leaf https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/ESP_MESH_LEAF.c and Test https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/ESP_MESH_TEST.c <br /><br />
- Firmware Over The Air (OTA) https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/FOTA_MQTT.c <br /><br />
- Pulse Width Modulation of in-built LED https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/PWM_LED.c <br /><br />
- UART Event functionality https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/UART_EVENT.c <br /><br />
- Simple Network Time Protocol https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/sntp.c <br /><br />

- BT Scan https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/ble_scan.c and WIFI Scan https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/WiFi_Details.c <br /><br />
- HTTP/S Connection ping https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/https_ping.c and <br /> - test https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/http_test.c <br /> - sample https://github.com/Gohith/Image-Processing-based-Embedded-Security-System/blob/main/http_sample.c<br /><br />

For detailed understanding of ESP32 and it's siblings please have a look at offiial source "http://esp32.net/" and from river to ocean here "https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/"
Enjoy the embedded system knowledge.<br />
